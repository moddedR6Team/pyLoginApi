# Python Login API
Python (Steam/Uplay) Login API with Steam(ValvePython)/Uplay and Flask

To get you have R6:S POST to Localhost:25565 (Port can be edited!)
Note:\
If you want to use this to production or elsewhere you should edit the port to something else.\
And obviously the localhost is will be your IP.\
Also Flask ask you to dont use that stuff on production, I have no idea how to make that safe, so have fun ðŸ˜Ž
